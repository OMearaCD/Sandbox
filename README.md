# Sandbox
Collection of mini-projects I've done for practice and to test out newly-learned functionalities. Mostly single-function.

OKgosite - A mockup of a website turned into an actual thing. 

navbar - A navbar mimicking the one on the website of the Newport Aquarium. Uses Datejs for date checking. A work in progress.

car_comparison - A form for users to input information about two different cars. When they hit submit, a CSV file with a table comparing the information entered is downloaded, and the user is redirected to a "success" page.

logoFadein.html - Features a transparent logo that becomes opaque when the user hovers over it, with a .3s delay.

navbar.html - Uses cubic-bezier to make a neat little navbar with items that expand and change color when hovered over. See comeara.com for an example.

demibot.js - Small bot made with Node.js and Discord.js. Uses the Discord API to respond to what users type in Discord chat. Posts memes, funny faces, and responds to certain key phrases. A work in progress.

greeter - Baby's first AJAX call. Greets the user based on what they typed in the box for 'gender.'

session login - Uses PHP Sessions to make a mimic login/logout feature. Enter your First and Last name to save to a session. Select "log out" to destroy the session and start over. Simple thing to build upon.

Edgy Username Generator.html - JavaScript version of Generator.java. Takes what the user entered and makes it resemble an edgy username by replacing letters and adding things based on RNG. Started as a joke, ended as legit JS practice.

Generator.java - First thing I've made in Java. User enters a boring username, and using .replace and random number selection, the program pops out a snazzy new username.
